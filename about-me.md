Hi, I'm Nathan Friend.  I live in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada, although I'm originally from the States.  In case you're not Canadian or have never read <a href="https://amzn.to/2vQZHka">Anne of Green Gables</a>, here's where PEI is:

    <figcaption>Yep, it's actually an island.  At least there's a bridge.</figcaption>

<p>
I currently work at <a href="https://www.maximuscanada.ca/">MAXIMUS DeltaWare</a> where I design and implement front-end interfaces for health care systems used across the nation.  I specialize in <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>, although I also enjoy working in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/">.NET</a>, particularly with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">Câ™¯</a>.
</p>

<p>
I received my bachelor's in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.dordt.edu/">Dordt College</a> in Sioux Center, Iowa and am currently working towards a <a href="http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/hci/">Masters in Human Computer Interaction from Iowa State University</a>.
</p>

<p>In my free time, I like to reinforce software engineer stereotypes by playing Ultimate Frisbee and <a href="/projects">working on side projects.</a> I also play the cello and do session work every chance I get.</p>

<p>Oh, and no, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Friend">I'm not an Australian rugby player.</a></p>
