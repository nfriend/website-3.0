Hi, I'm Nathan Friend.  I live in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada, although I'm originally from the States.  In case you're not Canadian or have never read <a href="https://amzn.to/2vQZHka">Anne of Green Gables</a>, here's where PEI is:

    <figcaption>Yep, it's actually an island.  At least there's a bridge.</figcaption>

<a href="/2018/12/04/the-next-chapter.html">I recently accepted a job</a> as a Senior Frontend Engineer at <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> on the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/product/continuous-integration/">Release (Continuous Delivery)</a> team, where I'll be building new features using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>. Check out what I'm up to on my <a href="https://gitlab.com/users/nathanfriend/activity">GitLab profile's activity page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Before joining GitLab, I worked in both the agriculture and healthcare industries, primarily using
<a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/">.NET</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">Câ™¯</a>.
</p>

<p>
I received my bachelor's in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.dordt.edu/">Dordt University</a> in Sioux Center, Iowa and am almost finished with a <a href="http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/hci/">Masters in Human-Computer Interaction from Iowa State University</a>.
</p>

<p>In my free time, I like to reinforce software engineer stereotypes by playing Ultimate Frisbee and <a href="/projects">working on side projects.</a> I also play the cello and do session work every chance I get.</p>

<p>Oh, and no, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Friend">I'm not an Australian rugby player.</a></p>
