Hi, I'm Nathan Friend. I'm a software engineer based out of a small town in Ontario, Canada.

I grew up in the States (in Iowa) but immigrated to Canada in 2015 and spent my
first several years in this country living on [a lovely rock floating in the
Atlantic](https://goo.gl/maps/CJZM5Q2NDJragd4dA).

I work remotely at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) as a Software Engineer on the
[Connect](https://stripe.com/connect) team.

Before Stripe, I worked at [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) as a Senior
Frontend Engineer on the
[Release team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/ops/release/),
where I built new features using
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript),
[Vue](https://vuejs.org/)/[Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/), and
[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). Check out [this page](/gitlab-contributions)
for some of the hightlights of my time at GitLab.

Before joining GitLab, I worked in both the agriculture and healthcare
industries, primarily using [Angular](https://angular.io/),
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/),
and
[.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net/)/[Câ™¯](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)>).

I received my bachelor's in Computer Science from [Dordt
University](https://www.dordt.edu/) in Sioux Center, Iowa and ~~am almost
finished with~~ recently completed a [Masters in Human-Computer Interaction from
Iowa State University](http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/hci/).

In my free time, I like to reinforce software engineer stereotypes by playing
Ultimate Frisbee and [working on side projects](/projects). I play the cello and
do session work every chance I get. I enjoy confusing my brain by [customizing
my keyboard

check out [this profile of me](https://people.ergodox-ez.com/nathan-friend/)
that the makers of [my keyboard](https://ergodox-ez.com/) put together.

Oh, and no, [I'm not an Australian rugby
player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Friend).
