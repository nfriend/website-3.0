I love teaching myself new technologies, and I learn best by doing. As a result,
I always have at least three or four side projects on the go. Below are a few
that managed to make it to a semi-finished state.

For a full list of all my side projects, check out my profile on
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/users/nfriend/projects) or
[GitHub](https://github.com/nfriend?tab=repositories).

For examples of my professional work, check out [this summary of my
contributions at GitLab](/gitlab-contributions) or take a look at [my
résumé](https://resume.nathanfriend.com).

## Inspiral

Inspiral is my most ambitious side project to date. It's a mobile app follow-up
to the web version (see below). Over 25,000 people signed up to be notified of
its release!

Everything about this project was new to me. It was my first time writing a
mobile app and publishing to either app store; my first time using both Dart and
Flutter; my first time monetizing a side project.

## Inspiral Web

This project earned me a few minutes of internet fame in 2014 when it trended on
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8698131) and
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/2kwc6k/incredibly_well_done_online_inspirograph_maker/).
I wrote up a more detailed post about this project [which you can read
here](/2015/01/26/inspiral-web.html).

## CoolToJS

One of my most rewarding projects, but perhaps one of the least flashy. CoolToJS
is a
[Cool](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_(programming_language)>)-to-JavaScript
transpiler, written for an online course I took for fun ([Stanford's _Compilers_
by Alex Aiken.](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-ycscs1-compilers)). This
project helped me develop a _much_ deeper appreciation for the compilers I use
every day.

## Theremin

When I saw the first demo of the [Leap Motion](https://amzn.to/2LB3jd4)
controller, I was hooked.

<figure markdown="1">
![A Leap Motion controller](/assets/img/projects/leap-motion-controller.jpg){:style="border: 1px solid #ddd;"}
<figcaption>A Leap Motion controller</figcaption>
</figure>

This little device tracks a user's hands in full 3D with incredible precision,
opening up a whole new class of human-computer interaction. And it retails for
about \$80!

Around the same time, I discovered the [Web Audio
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API). I have
always been fascinated with the intersection of technology and music - I grew up
in a musical family and even considered pursuing music professionally ([I
play](https://youtu.be/IEQqjCgrNQw) [the cello](https://youtu.be/4EZwNBJoiek)).
I began brainstorming side project ideas that would make use of this technology
when I ran across a video showcasing the creepy, futuristic sounds of the
[theremin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin), an electronic instrument
that is played without any physical contact:

<figure>
    <iframe class="rounded"
            width="500"
            height="315"
            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K6KbEnGnymk"
            frameborder="0"
            allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"
            allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
    <figcaption>"Over The Rainbow" played on a theremin.</figcaption>
</figure>

What a perfect application for the Leap Motion controller! I immediately began
building an in-browser theremin powered by the Web Audio API that used the Leap
Motion device as a controller.

Since these devices haven't really taken off (yet), it's probably safe to assume
you don't own one. That's okay, because I made a little demo video to showcase
the project:

<figure>
    <iframe class="rounded"
            width="500"
            height="888"

## Origins

A small web application that hosts a
[QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic) environment inside the browser
(using [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1)) and runs all the
little programs I wrote as a child when first learning to program. I wrote a
blog post about this project which [you can read

## Roggle

My Canadian ~~girlfriend~~ ~~fiancée~~ wife and I dated long-distance for about
a year before I made the leap across the border to [Prince Edward
Island](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Prince+Edward+Island/@46.6625399,-64.2347791,8z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4b5e52ddd47f83c5:0xa968d6d5f4926686!8m2!3d46.510712!4d-63.4168136)
to live closer to her. As a result, we spent _a lot_ of time on Skype. Since
five hours of non-stop conversation can be a bit exhausting, we would often play
video-chat-friendly games to pass the time.

One of our favorites was a little project I built called Roggle, a digital clone
of Boggle built with React. The project used WebSockets to synchronize the board
between countries to ensure my wife and I were always looking at the same set of
letters.

## Alexa Skills

I couldn't resist building a few [Alexa
skills](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=13727921011) when Amazon offered
[free Echo Dots for creating
skills.](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-developer-skill-promotion)
The end results were simple, but fun!

## WebGL Chess

The final project for a graduate course I took at
[ISU](https://www.iastate.edu/) (HCI 557: Computer Graphics and Geometric
Modeling) while working towards my Masters. Here are a couple of bullet points
stolen from the project's README on GitHub:

- Utilizes [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) Chess AI (in the form of
  [stockfish-js](https://github.com/exoticorn/stockfish-js)) to generate chess
  moves for both players client-side
- Full camera navigation using mouse (click + drag and scroll wheel), keyboard
  (arrow keys and <span class="keyboard-key">-</span> and <span
  class="keyboard-key">+</span>), and mobile gestures (drag to pan, pinch to
  zoom, two-finger rotate)
- Supports standard chess play - castling, substitution, check, etc.
- Written in vanilla WebGL - no wrapping or abstraction libraries used

Before you ask - unfortunately, no, you can't move the pieces yourself! The
Stockfish engine plays for both players.

- **Dates:** November - December, 2016

  [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/),

## nfjs

A naïve attempt at a client-side binding library, based on
[Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). Built to teach
myself how JavaScript binding frameworks are implemented.

Should you use this library? No, definitely not!

## Snow Day Notifier

My wife is a teacher, and [since we ~~live~~ used to live in PEI](/about-me), we
got [_lots_ of
snow](https://www.google.com/search?q=2015+pei+snow&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiS64fJ9vTlAhWXvJ4KHVxHCEIQ_AUIESgB&biw=1680&bih=885&dpr=2).
We liked to know as early as possible whether or not school was delayed or
cancelled. Since [I work from home](2018/12/04/the-next-chapter.html), no school
= no need to shovel the driveway.

This little project periodically scraped the [PEI Public Schools
website](https://edu.princeedwardisland.ca/psb/) and looked for mentions of
delays or closures. If it found something, it sent an alert (through
[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/)) to our phones.
