Like everyone else, I've been obsessed with
[Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) lately.

I was _really_ bad at it when I began. My original strategy was to use the first
3 or 4 guesses to uncover as many letters as possible, and then use the last few
guesses to actually find the solution. This turned out to be a terrible
approach, and I failed most of the challenges.

This got me thinking: what _is_ the optimal Wordle strategy?

And _that_ immediately lead to a second thought: can I automate it?

The answer is a resound **of course**! I present to you: **[Wordle
