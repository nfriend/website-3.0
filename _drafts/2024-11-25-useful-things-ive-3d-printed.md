3D printers are _ridiculously_ cool. There's something about seeing a digital object slowly manifest in the real world that is pure magic.

But they're also _useful_. Being able to custom manufacture replacement parts can save otherwise perfectly-working equipment from the landfill.

I've written before about some of the things I've 3D printed, including my [Zoom light]({% post_url 2024-05-31-zoom-light %}) and my [weird keyboard]({% post_url 2023-06-26-i-built-a-weird-keyboard %}); here are some other useful things I've printed:

## Monitor arm adapter

My main monitor - a [Samsung U28E590D](https://www.samsung.com/nz/business/monitors/flat/uhd-lu28e590ds-xy/) - has a terrible design flaw. It's [VESA mount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Display_Mounting_Interface) is at the very top of the monitor! This means that when connected to my [monitor arms](https://store.hermanmiller.com/office-furniture-desk-accessories-organization/jarvis-dual-monitor-arm/100348287.html?lang=en_CA&sku=100348287), it sits much too low, even with the arm at its maximum height.

While searching for solutions, I ran across [this adapter](https://www.monlines.com/portfolio-item/monlines-v014-vesa-adapter-for-samsung-u28e590d/), which effectively moves the VESA connection near the bottom of the monitor. Sadly, I couldn't find a way to purchase it in Canada. So I decided to design and print my own!

I originally printed the adapter in PETG, as PETG is strong and flexible and usually a better choice for functional prints. However, it was a little _too_ flexible - it caused my monitor to bounce around in a sickening way whenever I bumped my desk. I printed another in PLA (unfortunately the only color I had in enough quantity was a bright blue), which is much stiffer and mostly eliminated the wobble.

## SodaStream bottle stabalizer

I drink way too much carbonated water, usually straight from the SodaStream bottle. The bottles _look_ cool, but their tiny base resulted in many a messy spill.

I modeled a base using the exact curvature of the bottle's bottom, resulting in a _nearly_ untippable recepticle.

As silly as it sounds, this simple print might be the most-used 3D printed object in my house.

## Conduit cover

When we finished our basement, I installed a conduit in the wall with the idea that maybe someday I'd set up a ceiling-mounted projector and need a clean way to route the cables.

This left some unseemly holes in our wall once the drywall was in place:

I modeled and printed covers for each end of the conduit:

They weren't the cleanest prints, but it's a huge improvement over the previous look!

## Dryer lint filter handle

One of my earliest functional prints was a new lint filter handle for my in-laws' ancient dryer. The original handle had snapped off years ago and they has been using pliers to pull it out since then!

## Dryer lint trap seal

We had our laundry room drywalled, and as part of this work, the contractor installed [this terrible in-wall lint trap](https://www.amazon.ca/Vortex-Powerfan-inch-White-LT4/dp/B09C11F77P). Why is it so terrible? It has no latch, so every time the dryer starts, the filter pushes out of the wall, filling the room (and the entire house) with dryer lint dust!

I tried gluing some magnets to both the wall and the filter, hoping this would keep it in place, but the magnets were too finicky and didn't hold it flush against the wall. In the end, we just taped it to the wall, which only kind of worked.

## TV wall mount conduit

When I wall-mounted our TV, I wanted a clean look without any visible cables. This involved cutting two holes through the wall behind the TV so that the cables could be run into the storage room behind the wall and then back to the cabinet underneath the TV:

    <img loading="lazy" src="{{ '/assets/img/useful-things-ive-3d-printed/tv_mount_two_holes.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Two holes in the wall, ready for the conduit insert" />
    <figcaption>I let my son help me drill the holes the drywall; I think it was the highlight of his year</figcaption>
</figure>

To make this tidier, I printed two conduits that exactly matched the depth of the wall.

</figure>

This made running the cables much easier and cleaner.

</figure>

The end result is a floating TV that seemingly requires no power source or video cables!

</figure>

(You might also notice the LED backlighting; this is an ambient lighting setup I installed that is powered by [Hyperion](https://github.com/hyperion-project/hyperion.ng), which could be the subject of a blog post of its own!)

## 3D printer enclosure

I built my own 3D printer enclosure to help stablize the ambient temperature during prints (especially for plastic prone to warping, like PETG).

While the structure itself was mainly built from wood scraps, most of the joints, hinges, and other interesting pieces were 3D printed in white PETG.
