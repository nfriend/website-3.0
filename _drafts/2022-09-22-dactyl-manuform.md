### Generate STL using [https://github.com/ibnuda/dactyl-keyboard/tree/refaktor](https://github.com/ibnuda/dactyl-keyboard/tree/refaktor)

- Initially tried to generate with hot-swap sockets, then gave up
- Goal is to match [my ErgoDox EZ layout](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/ergodox_ez/keymaps/nfriend/readme.md) as much as possible
- Also wanted an aggressive tent angle (went with Ï€/8)
- Helpful Hacker News comment: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23445208](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23445208)

### A few minor tweaks, and then generate and slice final STL

- Decided to use external Pro Micro controller holder, which I could only find in the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20220607031910/https://dactyl.siskam.link/loligagger-external-holder-promicro-v2.stl)
- Decided to add my own screw holes since the generated ones were awkwardly placed
- [Link to JSON config]({{ 'assets/other/dactyl-manuform/config.json' | relative_url }})
- [Link to hosted version of STL generator](https://dactyl.mbugert.de/)
- [Link to final STL]({{ 'assets/other/dactyl-manuform/case.stl' | relative_url }})
