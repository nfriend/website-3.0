Like everyone else, I've been obsessed with
[Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) lately.

I was _really_ bad at it when I began. My original strategy was to use the first
3 or 4 guesses to uncover as many letters as possible, and then use the last few
guesses to unscramble the solution. This turned out to be a terrible approach,
and I failed most of the challenges.

This got me thinking: what _is_ the optimal Wordle strategy?

And _that_ immediately led to a second thought: can I automate it?

The answer is a resounding **of course**! I present to you: [Wordle
Bot](https://twitter.com/bot_wordle/)!

## How it works

The general strategy is to repeatedly pick the word that is most likely to
reveal new letters. To do this, I use the frequency of each letter in the set of
possible solutions to assign a score to each potential guess, and choose the
option with the highest score.

The set of all possible solutions is conveniently hardcoded in Wordle's source
code, so my first step is [to simply hardcode this list into my own
script](https://gitlab.com/nfriend/wordle-solver/-/blob/a2e90c02e6acbf4c002356dfe1fca9851c6915e2/src/index.ts#L2).

Next, [I loop through each potential
solution](https://gitlab.com/nfriend/wordle-solver/-/blob/a2e90c02e6acbf4c002356dfe1fca9851c6915e2/src/index.ts#L4-19)
and count how many times each letter occurs. This results in a mapping like
this:

```json
{
  "e": 1233,
  "a": 979,
  "r": 899,
  "o": 754,
  "t": 729,
  "l": 719,
  "i": 671,
  "s": 669,
  "n": 575,
  "c": 477,
  "u": 467,
  "y": 425,
  "d": 393,
  "h": 389,
  "p": 367,
  "m": 316,
  "g": 311,
  "b": 281,
  "f": 230,
  "k": 210,
  "w": 195,
  "v": 153,
  "z": 40,
  "x": 37,
  "q": 29,
  "j": 27
}
```

So, for example, a word like "HELLO" would score 3,814 (389 \+ 1,233 \+ 719 \+
719 \+ 754).

Using this method, the bot would _always_ start with the word "EERIE", due to
its high score of 5,269 (1,233 + 1,233 + 899 + 671 + 1,233).

However, this actually isn't a very useful guess! It only gives us information
about 3 letters. A more strategic method is to pick the highest scoring word
_that contains no repeating letters_. Using this approach, the best first play
is "LATER", which still scores quite high (4,559 = 719 \+ 979 \+ 729 \+ 1,233 \+ 899) _and_ provides information about 5 different letters.

(Side note: Even though I know I _should_ start with "LATER" when playing on my
own, I can't help but start with "ADIEU" - too many vowels to pass up!)

Each subsequent guess is generated using the same algorithm, except that the
list of possible solutions is shrunk by eliminating all options that contradict
the results of previous guesses. A side effect of this elimination method is
that it effectively plays the game on Hard Mode. (Hard Mode = "Any revealed
hints must be used in subsequent guesses").

In later guesses, it's possible there _won't_ be a valid option that includes no
repeating letters, so in this case the bot [falls back to the highest-scoring
word regardless of letter
repetition](https://gitlab.com/nfriend/wordle-solver/-/blob/a2e90c02e6acbf4c002356dfe1fca9851c6915e2/src/index.ts#L170).

## Demo

Here's an example of the script working in
[bookmarklet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) form:

<figure>
    <img src="{{ 'assets/img/wordle/wordle-demo.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="A demo of Wordle being solved by the script in bookmarklet form" />
</figure>

(Instruction for setting up this script as a bookmarklet can be found
[here](https://gitlab.com/nfriend/wordle-solver#usage).)

## How good is it?

The short answer is: quite good! (_Much_ better than me.) But not perfect!

At the time of writing, Wordle Bot has solved 220 puzzles. Its guess
distribution looks like this:

<figure>
    <img src="{{ 'assets/img/wordle/guess-distribution.png' | relative_url }}" alt="A chart showing Wordle Bot's guess distribution" />
</figure>

80% of the time, Wordle Bot can solve the daily puzzle in 4 tries or less. Not
bad!

But why isn't it perfect? I was intrigued by the two puzzles it failed to solve.
In both cases, Wordle Bot failed in a similar fashion. By guess 3, it had nailed
down letters 2 - 5. It spent the remaining guesses cycling through different
starting letters, and failed to find the correct one before it ran out of
guesses.

Here is its attempt at puzzle 113:

<figure>
    <img src="{{ 'assets/img/wordle/puzzle-113.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="A screenshot of Wordle Bot's solution to puzzle 113" />
    <figcaption>Wordle 113</figcaption>
</figure>

Even though the correct solution ("HATCH") scores higher than all the options it
tried ("PATCH", "MATCH", "BATCH", and "WATCH"), it chose not to guess "HATCH"
since it includes a repeated letter ("H"). As mentioned earlier, the algorithm
always prefers guesses without repetition if they exist.

A similar thing happened on day 123:

<figure>
    <img src="{{ 'assets/img/wordle/puzzle-123.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="A screenshot of Wordle Bot's solution to puzzle 123" />
    <figcaption>Wordle 123</figcaption>
</figure>

In this case, the solution "JAUNT" scored lower than all the options it tried
("DAUNT", "HAUNT", "GAUNT", and "VAUNT"), so it simply ran out of time.

## Bringing the bot to life

Turning the script into a Twitter bot was just a matter of automation.

First, I built a [Puppeteer
script](https://gitlab.com/nfriend/wordle-solver/-/blob/a2e90c02e6acbf4c002356dfe1fca9851c6915e2/twitter-bot/index.js)
to launch Wordle in an instance of headless Chrome, inject my bookmarklet
script, and solve the puzzle. Once it's finished, the script [takes a
screenshot, uploads it to
Imgur](https://gitlab.com/nfriend/wordle-solver/-/blob/a2e90c02e6acbf4c002356dfe1fca9851c6915e2/twitter-bot/screenshot-and-upload-to-imgur.js),
and [tweets the
results](https://gitlab.com/nfriend/wordle-solver/-/blob/a2e90c02e6acbf4c002356dfe1fca9851c6915e2/twitter-bot/index.js#L182-188):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wordle 220 3/6<br><br>â¬œðŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œðŸŸ©<br>ðŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©<br>ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©<br><br>Full solution [<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPOILER?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SPOILER</a>!]: <a href="https://t.co/kXojDt5u3i">https://t.co/kXojDt5u3i</a></p>&mdash; Wordle Bot (@bot_wordle) <a href="https://twitter.com/bot_wordle/status/1485940275180711940?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Then, I configured a [scheduled GitLab
pipeline](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/schedules.html) to run [the
project's
pipeline](https://gitlab.com/nfriend/wordle-solver/-/blob/a2e90c02e6acbf4c002356dfe1fca9851c6915e2/.gitlab-ci.yml)
every day at 3:00 AM ET.

Even though the end result is fairly simple, I ran into a number of speed bumps
along the way:

- Wordle shares its results by copying them to the clipboard, but I couldn't
  figure out a way to access the clipboard's contents inside Puppeteer (it
  always returned my _system_ clipboard contents instead). To get around this, I
  had to [build the "share" text
  myself](https://gitlab.com/nfriend/wordle-solver/-/blob/a2e90c02e6acbf4c002356dfe1fca9851c6915e2/twitter-bot/index.js#L101-152).
- The [Imgur JavaScript library](https://github.com/KenEucker/imgur) I use
  required Node 14+, but [the Puppeteer Docker
  image](https://github.com/alekzonder/docker-puppeteer) I was using inside my
  GitLab pipeline was stuck on Node 12. Switching to
  [`buildkite/puppeteer`](https://github.com/buildkite/docker-puppeteer) fixed
  this.
- The pipeline would randomly fail while trying to connect to the Wordle
  website: `Error: net::ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED at https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/`. I "solved" this by adding a
  [`timeout`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#timeout) and
  [`retry`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#retry) to [my GitLab
  job](https://gitlab.com/nfriend/wordle-solver/-/blob/a2e90c02e6acbf4c002356dfe1fca9851c6915e2/.gitlab-ci.yml#L21-22).

## Absurdal

Oh, did I mention the bot is also surprisingly good at solving the
[Absurdal](https://qntm.org/files/wordle/index.html) variant?
