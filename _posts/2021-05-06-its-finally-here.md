It's been almost seven years since [Inspiral
Web](https://nathanfriend.com/inspiral-web/) was released.

For most of those seven years, the site included a "Get the app" button that
popped open a message that read "Inspiral Web isn't mobile friendly... yet" and
included a link to join the mailing list.

Over 25,000 people joined that mailing list. The sheer number of interested
people, combined with just a _bit_ of pandemic cabin fever, spurred me to
_finally_ begin work in earnest on the mobile app.

After five months of feverish, bleary-eyed, nights-and-weekends coding, I'm
thrilled to announce that Inspiral is now available for iOS and Android!
