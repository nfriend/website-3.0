# website-3.0

Another iteration of my personal website.  This one is blog-focused and utilizes Jekyll for content management.

## Building

To bundle and run this website locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` at the root of this project.

## TODO

- Finish "About me", "Contact", "Projects", and "Attributions" pages
- Cross-browser testing
- Figure out how minify and deploy
- Remove placeholder blog posts
- Create favicon
- Test Google Analytics
- Old fonts are still being referenced - remove.
- Start blogging
