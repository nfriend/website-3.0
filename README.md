# website-3.0

Another iteration of my personal website.  This one is blog-focused and utilizes Jekyll for content management.

## Building

To bundle and run this website locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` at the root of this project.

## TODO

- Finish "About me" and "Projects" pages
- Start blogging
- Make "Other posts you may enjoy" show related posts instead of just the five most recent
- Add Discourse comments to blog posts?
