# website-3.0

Another iteration of personal website.  This one is blog-focused and utilizes Jekyll for content management.

## Building

To bundle and run this website locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` at the root of this project.

## TODO

- Link hover style could be improved (right now it causes surrounding content to jump).
- Finish "About me" and "Contact" pages
- Cross-browser testing
- Google Analytics
- Add "projects" link
- Figure out how minify and deploy
- Remove placeholder blog posts
- Start blogging
