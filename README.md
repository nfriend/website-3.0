# website-3.0

Another iteration of my personal website.  This one is blog-focused and utilizes Jekyll for content management.

## Building

To bundle and run this website locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` at the root of this project.

## TODO

- Add og: tags for social media (VSCode blog as an example)
- Create real environment for site and deploy
- Finish "About me", "Contact", "Projects", and "Attributions" pages
- Remove placeholder blog posts
- Test Google Analytics
- SSL
- Start blogging
- Make "Other posts you may enjoy" show related posts instead of just the five most recent
