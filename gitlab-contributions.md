One of the coolest things about working at [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
is that [_every_ line of code I write is source-available, and most of it is
open
source.](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2016/07/20/gitlab-is-open-core-github-is-closed-source/)

As a result, my public contributions to GitLab serve as an unusually detailed
record of my professional work:

- [All merge requests authored by
  me](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=merged&author_username=nfriend)
- [All issues opened by
  me](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues?author_username=nfriend&scope=all&sort=created_date&state=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93)
- [All commits authored by
  me](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commits/master?author=Nathan%20Friend)
- [My recent GitLab.com activity](https://gitlab.com/users/nfriend/activity)

Below are some of the highlights of my time at GitLab, complete with links to
all the nitty-gritty details.

## Merge trains

One of the most interesting features I helped build during my first year at
GitLab is [merge
trains](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/merge_request_pipelines/pipelines_for_merged_results/merge_trains/),
a conceptually simple feature with a _lot_ of behind-the-scenes complexity. I
wrote the majority of the frontend code for this feature; here's a list of all
the merge train-related merge requests I put together:

- [!21572: Add example of .gitlab-ci.yml that uses only: [merge_requests] and
  excludes specific
  branches](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/21572){:target="\_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- [!21556: Show "merge immediately" dialog when MR's pipeline has not yet
  finished](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/21556)
- [!21060: Add documentation for new "merge immediately" workflow for merge
  trains](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/21060)
- [!20054: Add warning dialog when users click "Merge immediately" merge train
  option](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/20054)
- [!15535: Resolve "Rename \`ATMTWPS\` to \`MTWPS\` in
  code"](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/15535)
- [!14894: Fix the merge button
  dropdown](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/14894)
- [!14097: Add merge train helper text to merge request
  widget](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/14097)
- [!14064: Add merge train position
  indicator](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/14064)
- [!12156: Update the merge request widget's "Merge" button to support merge
  trains](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/12156)
- [!10803: Add "Allow merge trains" option to project settings
  page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/10803)

## GitLab Pages + Let's Encrypt

This feature was particularly fun to develop since I was part of the target
audience!

- [!26438: Add Let's Encrypt option in Pages domain new/edit Haml
  form](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/26438)

## Releases page

Since I'm a part of the [Release Management
group](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#release-management-group),
it should come as no surprise that I spend a _lot_ of time modifying the
[**Releases** page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/).

### REST â†’ GraphQL Conversion

When I joined GitLab, we had _just_ started building out our GraphQL endpoint.
Now, our goal is to [make GraphQL the **primary** means of interacting
programmatically with GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/#vision).

I took this to heart, dug into in the [`graphql`](https://graphql-ruby.org/)
gem, and built out all of the [Release REST
APIs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/releases/) in GraphQL:

- [!30753: Add basic Release GraphQL
  endpoint](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/30753)
- [!30873: Add additional data to Release GraphQL
  endpoint](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/30873)
- [!33538: Adjust permissions for Release data in GraphQL
  endpoint](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/33538)
- [!33612: Add links to Release data from GraphQL
  endpoint](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/33612)
- [!35066: Add milestone stats to GraphQL
  endpoint](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/35066)
- [!40147: Add total count of project releases to GraphQL
  endpoint](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/40147)
- [!41170: Add release `direct_asset_url` to
  GraphQL](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/41170)
- [!41183: Add release `upcoming_release` field to
  GraphQL](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/41183)
- [!45577: Update GraphQL endpoint to support sorting
  releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/45577)
- [!46161: Add link paths for release progress view to
  GraphQL](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/46161)
- [!46263: Add GraphQL mutation to create a new
  release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/46263)
- [!46611: Add GraphQL mutation to update a
  release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/46611)
- [!48364: Add GraphQL mutation to delete
  release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/48364)
- [!54605: Add GraphQL mutation to create release asset
  link](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/54605)
- [!56265: Add GraphQL mutation to update release asset
  link](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/56265)
- [!56417: Add GraphQL mutation to delete release asset
  link](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/56417)

Then, I updated our frontends to use this new GraphQL data:

- [!56882: Convert individual release page to
  VueApollo](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/56882)
- [!61828: Convert Releases index page to Apollo
  Client](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/61828)
- [!62234: Add pagination controls to new Releases
  page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/62234)
- [!62848: Add sort controls to new Releases
  page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/62848)

This conversion made it easier to implement some [frontend performance
improvements](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330784):

- [!63528: Progressively load releases on the Releases
  page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/63528)
- [!63914: Update the Releases page to make use of startup
  queries](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/63914)

The part I'm most proud of? Despite swapping out the entire backend of the
**Releases** page, no one's seemed to notice ðŸ˜€

### Associating Releases to Milestones

[As of GitLab 12.5, Releases can be associated with one or more
Milestones.](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/#releases-associated-with-milestones)
Developing this feature involved lots of small changes throughout the codebase:

- [!16558: Add Release Links to Milestone List
  Page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/16558)
- [!16562: Add milestones to release
  blocks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/16562)
- [!17091: Update release blocks to support multiple
  milestones](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/17091)
- [!17150: Allow release blocks to be scrolled to using URL anchor
  tags](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/17150)
- [!32360: Add \`id\` attribute to release
  blocks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/32360)
- [!17278: Add links to associated release(s) to the milestone detail page
  sidebar](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/17278)
- [!19581: Document Milestone <> Release
  feature](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/19581)

### Allow Releases to be created and edited through the UI

When I joined GitLab, Releases could only be created or modified using the
[Release API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/releases/#create-a-release). This
(still ongoing!) effort helped make Releases simpler to use:

- [!18033: Add "Edit Release"
  page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/18033)
- [!18411: Add "edit" button to release blocks on Releases
  page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/18411)
- [!19226: Update release blocks to look for correct property name in API
  response](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/19226)
- [!19321: Update "Tag name" help text on Edit Release
  page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/19321)
- [!19595: Add documentation for new "edit release"
  feature/page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/19595)
- [!20075: Update "Edit release" page feature flag to be enabled by
  default](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/20075)
- [!21425: Update the "Edit release" feature's version from 12.5 to 12.6 in the
  documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/21425)
- [!21767: Remove the `:release_search_filter` feature
  flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/21767)
- [!23810: Remove test that references`release_edit_page` feature
  flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/23810)

### Add a "dedicated" Release page

Originally, the only way to view GitLab Releases was on the **Releases** page,
which showed _all_ Releases for a given project. This feature added a new page â€”
a **Release** page â€” that displayed a Release individually:

- [!23792: Create backend route for dedicated Release
  page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/23792)
- [!23816: Make titles on the Releases page link to dedicated Release
  page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/23816)
- [!23896: Add "self" link to Release API
  response](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/23896)

### Releases page upgrades

Some modification to make the **Releases** page more valuable:

- [!19451: Move release meta-data into footer on Releases
  page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/19451)
- [!19448: Add issue stats to release blocks on the Releases
  page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/19448)

### Release searching

As part of our effort to make Releases more useful, we added the ability to
search for issues and merge requests by Release:

- [!18761: Add "release" filter to issue
  search](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/18761)
- [!19315: Add "release" filter to merge request
  search](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/19315)
- [!19951: Update documentation for new "Release:"
  filter](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/19951)
- [!20076: Update release search filter feature flag to be enabled by
  default](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/20076)

## Quality of life

Every once in a while I step outside the boundaries of the Release Management
group and fix something that bugs me:

- [!20738: Add \`pngquant:compress\` and \`pngquant:lint\` rake
  tasks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/20738)
- [!16545: Suppress AJAX errors caused by browser
  navigation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/16545)
- [!27683: Make pipeline failure Slack notifications prettier and more
  informative](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/27683)
- [!25925: Add core-js polyfill for
  Promise.finally()](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/25925)
- [!594: Allow GlTooltip delay to be customized through
  localStorage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/merge_requests/594)

## Keyboard shortcuts

This could probably fit into the "quality of life" category above, but it's
consumed enough of my time that it's worth calling out separately.

I care a _lot_ about keyboard accesibility, and I've taken it on myself to make
sure GitLab has best-in-class keyboard support.

I recently implemented a few nice-to-have shortcuts:

- [!40328: Add Markdown editor keyboard
  shortcuts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/40328)

And I'm currently working on a much more ambitious redesign of how we implement
shortcuts:

- [#251226: Allow keyboard shortcuts to be
  customized](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/251226)
